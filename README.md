Exploritory Analysis of Health Metrics correlations

Using linear and logistic regressions, principle factor analysis and K-nearest neighbors, data was aggregated for a two month period from 60 fitbit users that contained metrics of calories burned, steps taken, intensity of activity, BMI, Weight, and other health indices.  The purpose was to conduct an exploratory analysis to determine the behaviors of the variables and to provide possible insight to the benefits (or lack thereof) of activity trackers.
